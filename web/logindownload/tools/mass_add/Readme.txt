mass_add.php

You can add multiple files at once by using the mass_add.php file. This
lists all the files in a specified directory and then allows you to edit
the details for each one before adding them all to the site. In addition, 
you can select to extract ID3 (www.id3.org) data from any media files you
have uploaded.

Copy the mass_add.php file and the getid3/ directory (if you wish to use the ID3
features) into your OD3 directory (e.g. upload/) and then upload to your
website. Using your web browser, browse to the location of the page and follow
the on screen instructions.

e.g. if you uploaded the upload/ directory to /downloads, you would browse to
http://www.example.com/downloads/mass_add.php

Once you have finished, delete the file from your site.

You can find out more about the ID3 class used in the getid3/ directory by
viewing the .txt files.
