.htaccess

Although OD3 includes leech protection code, you can enhance this by using the
sample .htaccess file provided. This is for use with the Apache webserver only
and will help to prevent leeching of your files.

You will need to edit the file to include your domain name and the file extensions
you wish to protect.

Copy the file into your OD3 directory (e.g. upload/) and then upload to your
website. You do not need to do anything else - leech protection is automatically
enabled.
